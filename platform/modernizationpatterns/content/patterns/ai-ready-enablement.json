  "summary": "Enable the organization to safely and systematically adopt AI-assisted engineering across architecture, development, DevOps, and operations to accelerate time to market while maintaining governance and quality.",
  "decisionGuidance": {
    "problemSolved": "Organizations struggle to scale AI adoption because teams lack context engineering practices, governance guardrails, ethical guidance, and operational integration across the SDLC.",
    "whenToUse": [
      "You plan to use GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or agentic workflows across multiple teams",
      "You want AI embedded into development, DevOps, and operations processes",
      "You need faster feature delivery without sacrificing architectural integrity",
      "You are modernizing legacy systems and want AI to accelerate the transition"
    ],
    "whenNotToUse": [
      "AI experimentation is isolated and not intended for production workflows",

      "Letting AI operate without bounded architectural constraints",
      "Ignoring ethical, compliance, and data sensitivity concerns"
    ],
    "opinionatedGuidance": "Treat AI as a constrained co-engineer, not an autonomous system. Define architectural boundaries, domain contracts, and a clear definition of done. Establish human-in-the-loop review, measure cycle time improvements, and continuously refine prompts and Copilot instructions based on real outcomes. Start now, but scale at a pace aligned with organizational comfort and maturity."
