    "problemSolved": "Getting code to production becomes a bottleneck without automated security, compliance, and quality gates. Manual processes don't scale and introduce risk.",
    "whenToUse": [
      "Always — you should always have great DevSecOps",
      "Multiple teams need standardized, consistent delivery paths",

      "Not taking this seriously — problems getting code to production are a business liability",
      "Not stopping to automate things that should be automated — manual gates don't scale",
      "Not getting your security officer involved early when building security protocols and governance",

      "Security exceptions become invisible risk over time",
      "Overly heavy gates slow delivery and frustrate teams"
    ],
    "opinionatedGuidance": "Do process engineering first. Step back, understand how you want delivery to work, then build toward that vision. Be creative with ephemeral environments, AI-assisted reviews, and automated testing. Get senior leadership buy-in that secure, fast delivery is a competitive advantage. Automate the basics (scans, policies) and focus humans on true risk decisions."

  "complexity": {
    "level": "medium",

    "skillDemand": "Security engineering, CI/CD expertise, GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps fluency, policy-as-code, and enablement skills.",
    "operationalDemand": "High — directly affects production safety, velocity, and confidence. Must be reliable and fast.",
    "toolingDemand": "GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, automated testing, secrets management, environment gating, rollback mechanisms."

  "realWorldExample": {
    "context": "A ticketing company undergoing modernization needed to move fast without sacrificing security, compliance, or quality. Multiple teams were delivering features daily.",
    "approach": "Built a tight DevSecOps system with GitHub Actions, GitHub Advanced Security, automated testing, environment gating, and automatic rollback. All security, governance, and compliance checks were automated and shift-left. Developers could click a button to deploy from the main branch at any time. The enablement team trained all product teams on how to plug into the platform.",
    "outcome": "Teams deployed code 10+ times a day without issue. Developers could deploy while at dinner without worry. The system automatically handled rollback if production issues occurred. This became a massive enabler for delivering features faster during their modernization journey. Zero manual gates, zero late-stage surprises."
