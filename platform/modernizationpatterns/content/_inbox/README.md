# Raw Source Inbox

Drop raw source material here for curation.

Supported intake examples:
- `.md`
- `.pdf`
- `.docx`
- `.pptx`
- exported notes or links

Notes:
- Files in this folder are authoritative source inputs.
- This folder is for curation workflow and is not used directly by the website UI.
- If a source should be cited, add/update an entry in `../sources/sources.json` and reference it in pattern files.
- Home-built internal slide decks can be used without citation if desired.
