## Known Limitations

### Architectural Limitations (By Design)
1. **File detection only**: Does not download or store file content (out of scope)
2. **Schedule precision**: ±1 minute (polling-based, not real-time)
3. **Eventual consistency**: Message-based integration (no immediate feedback)

### Current Implementation Limitations
1. **Cosmos DB health check**: Placeholder implementation (functional but not integrated)
2. **Worker coordination**: Multiple workers may poll simultaneously (mitigated by idempotency)
3. **Connection pooling**: Implemented but not fully optimized (acceptable for MVP)

### None Blocking Production Deployment

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Cosmos DB throttling** | Autoscale provisioning, partition key design | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Schedule drift** | 60s polling, performance testing validates <1min | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Duplicate workflow triggers** | Unique constraint + idempotency checks | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Protocol connection failures** | Retry logic, error categorization, runbook | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Credential leakage** | Key Vault integration, no logs | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Cross-client access** | JWT claims validation, partition isolation | ✅ Mitigated |

### Operational Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Configuration errors** | FluentValidation, input validation | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Missing troubleshooting guidance** | Comprehensive runbook with 8 scenarios | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Insufficient monitoring** | Application Insights, custom metrics, health checks | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Deployment complexity** | Detailed deployment guide, health check support | ✅ Mitigated |

**Overall Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** (all critical risks mitigated)

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Protocol Abstraction Works Well**: IProtocolAdapter interface enabled parallel development of 3 protocol adapters
2. **Idempotency is Critical**: Unique constraint + IdempotencyKey prevents duplicate workflow triggers (SC-007)
3. **Partition Key Design Matters**: `/clientId` enables efficient single-partition queries
4. **Message-Based Integration Scales**: No direct HTTP dependencies simplifies testing and scaling
5. **Health Checks Essential**: Container Apps probes require `/health/live` and `/health/ready`

### Process Insights
1. **Specification First**: Complete spec.md before implementation prevented rework
2. **Task Breakdown**: 148 granular tasks enabled clear progress tracking
3. **Phased Approach**: Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish minimized blocking
4. **Test-Driven**: Tests defined upfront validated requirements
5. **Constitution Compliance**: Upfront adherence prevented architectural debt

### Best Practices Validated
1. ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Clear layer separation improves testability
2. ✅ **Repository Pattern**: Decouples domain from data access technology
3. ✅ **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency inversion throughout
4. ✅ **Domain-Driven Design**: Ubiquitous language, bounded contexts
5. ✅ **Async/Await**: Full async pipeline for scalability

## Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment
1. ✅ **Code Review** (T144): Automated verification complete, peer review recommended
2. ⏳ **Integration Testing** (T146): Test with real Azure resources (Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Azure Blob)
3. ⏳ **Staging Validation**: Deploy to staging, run smoke tests, monitor 24 hours
4. ⏳ **Production Secrets**: Configure Key Vault secrets for client credentials
5. ⏳ **Monitoring Setup**: Create Application Insights dashboards, configure alerts

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor schedule drift (should be <1 min for 99% of executions)
2. Track idempotency effectiveness (zero duplicate triggers)
3. Measure actual protocol latencies (FTP vs HTTPS vs Azure Blob)
4. Gather operations feedback on runbook effectiveness
5. Optimize based on production metrics

### Future Enhancements
1. Add AWS S3 protocol support (extensibility proven)
2. Add SFTP protocol support (SSH-based file transfer)
3. Add UI for configuration management (React or Blazor)
4. Add webhook integration as alternative to Service Bus
5. Add file content validation (e.g., CSV schema validation)
