# Specification Quality Checklist: Client File Retrieval Configuration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Validation Date**: 2025-01-24

**Details**:
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- 6 user stories defined with clear priorities (P1-P3) and independent testability
- 24 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- 10 success criteria, all measurable and technology-agnostic
- 9 edge cases identified with resolution guidance
- Comprehensive scope boundaries, assumptions, and dependencies documented
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- Implementation details removed from FR-024, Assumptions, and Dependencies sections
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Written for non-technical stakeholders (business language throughout)

## Readiness Assessment

✅ **READY FOR NEXT PHASE**: This specification is complete and ready for either:
- `/speckit.plan` - Proceed directly to implementation planning
- Skip planning phase - Begin implementation with this specification as the requirements baseline

## Notes

No issues found. Specification meets all quality criteria for a production-ready requirements document.
